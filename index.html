				<h2>Referendum Map Münster</h2>
                <p align ="justify">Welcome to the Referendum Map Münster. Here you are provided
                 with infomation regarding the recent referendum that took place
				         in Münster on November 6th in 2016. The referendum took place to decide whether some shops
                 should be open on two additional Sundays - for Hansetag and Herbstsent - or not.
                 The affected shops are those of the city center and part of the Hammerstreet.</p>

                <p align ="justify">The polling stations were well distributed throughout Münster
                 in order to get the opinion of as many people as possible in the form of votes.
                 Here you can find a visual representation of the results from all
                 the different stations. The data presented is the
                 number of people that were eligible for voting, the number of people
                 that actually voted, invalid votes, valid votes, number of people in
                 favor of this decision and number of people against it. </p>

                <p align ="justify">The representation shows the major areas of Münster and the colours (Green or Red)
                 of the corresponding areas denote the overall result from that particular station.
                 For example the areas highlighted green show that majority of the voters of that
                 area voted in support of the shops being opened on additional Sundays and areas in red colour
                 show the opposite outcome. Results are also displayed in the form of a pie chart on the pop-up.</p>
