				<h2>Referendum Map Münster</h2>
                <p align ="justify">Welcome to the Referendum Map Münster. Here you are provided
                 with infomation regarding the recent referendum that took place
				         in Münster on November 6th in 2016. The referendum took place to decide whether some shops
                 should be open on three additional Sundays or not.
                 The affected shops are those in the two main shopping streets in the inner city
                 (Salzstraße and Prinzipalmarkt).</p>

                <p align ="justify">The polling stations were well distributed throughout Münster
                 in order to get the opinion of as many people in the form of votes.
                 Here is a visual representation of the results from all
                 the different stations. The data that we are interested in is the
                 number of people that are eligible for voting, the number of people
                 that actually voted, invalid votes, valid votes, number of people in
                 favor of this and number of people against this decision. </p>

                <p align ="justify">Our representation shows the major areas of Münster and the colours (Green or Red)
                 of the corresponding areas denote the overall result from that particular station.
                 For example the areas highlighted as green, show that majority of the voters in that
                 area voted in support of the shops being opened on these Sundays and areas in red colour
                 show the opposite trend. Results are also displayed in the form of a pie chart on the pop-up.</p>

                    at the Institute for Geoinformatics. The course "Geoinforamtion in Society" was about turning existing
					data to geographic linked open data and build a software application which consumes data and to visualize it.
