				<h2>Referendum Map Münster</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the Referendum Map Münster. Here you will be provided
                    with infomation regarding the recent referendum that took place
				    in Münster on November 6th in 2016. The referendum took place to detect wehther some shops 
                    should be open on three additional Sundays or be closed. 
                    The affected shops are those in the two main shopping streets in the inner city 
                    (Salzstraße and Prinzipalmarkt).
                </p>

                <p align ="justify">The polling stations were well distributed throughout Münster
                 in order to get the opinion of as many people in the form of votes.
                 Here is a visual representation of the results from all
                 the different stations. The data that we are interested in is the
                 number of people that were eligible for voting, the number of people
                 that actually voted, invalid votes, valid votes, number of people in
                 favor of this and number of people against this decision. </p>
                <p>This Application provides a visual representation of the results from the referendum 
                    devided according to the different voting districts. The coloured districts showing 
                    the overall result for the particular district. By zooming in and out the user 
                    will be provided with more or less voting districts. By clicking on the districts 
                    additional information are shown, like the number of Yes- and No-votes.  
                </p>

                <p align ="justify">Our representation shows the major areas of Münster and the colours (Green or Red)
                 of the corresponding areas denote the overall result from that particular station.
                 For example the areas highlighted as green, show that majority of the voters in that
                 area voted in support of the shops being opened on these Sundays and areas in red colour
                 show the opposite trend. Apart from the this the results can also be seen in
                 figures and on pie charts. </p>

                <h2> The Project</h2>
                <p> This Application was part of a project that was carried out as part of a course that took place
                    at the Institut for Geoinformatics. The course is part of the master study programm "Geoinformatics".
                    The course "Geoinforamtion in Society" was about turning existing data to geographic linked open data 
                    and build a software application which consumes the data and visualize it.
                </p>
