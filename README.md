## Installation
The code here can be simply downloaded using the

```
command.
If you want to have a look at the results locally you just have to change into the newly created directory and open the files `index.html` and `ReferendumVocabulary.html` for the map and the vocabulary documentation, using your browser.

To host the project on the web just move the directory's content to a location the root folder of your web server.
